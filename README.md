# Movie Rating & Review Analysis using SQL

## Overview
This project analyzes movie ratings and user reviews using SQL.
It focuses on extracting insights such as top-rated movies, active users,
genre performance, and rule-based movie recommendations.

## Tech Stack
- MySQL
- SQL (Joins, Aggregations, Views, Window Functions)

## Key Features
- Average and top-rated movie analysis
- User activity and engagement tracking
- Genre-based rating insights
- Rule-based movie recommendation using SQL views
- Recent review monitoring

## SQL Concepts Used
- INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN
- GROUP BY, HAVING
- Aggregate functions (AVG, COUNT)
- Views
- Window functions (RANK)
- Subqueries

## Recommendation Logic
Recommendations are generated using SQL-based ranking rules,
primarily based on average ratings and minimum rating counts.
This is a rule-based analytical system, not machine learning.

## Files
- `queries.sql` — analytical SQL queries
- `views.sql` — reusable views for reporting and recommendations
